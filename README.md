# HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM PREDICTION: 
Problem Statement :
The main goal of this project to predict the health insurance premium for a person based on their health conditions. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an insurance policy rather than the ineffective part.

# DATASET:
The dataset is taken from Kaggle site. Yo can download the dataset from :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noordeen/insurance-premium-prediction

# APPROACH :
Data is collected from kaggle site. All the required tasks to prepare the data for model buliding such as data cleaning, pre-processing, data exploration,visualisation were done.
##### 1.Data exploration: Exploring the dataset using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly and seaborn.
##### 2.Exploratory Data Analysis : Plotted different graphs to get more insights about dependent and independent variables/features.
##### 3.Feature Engineering : There are numerical and categorical features are present. Scaling was performed on numerical data and encoding of categorical data is done.
##### 4.Model Building : For model building, data was splitted into training and testing set.After splitting various algorithms were used to train our model.
 	⇥Linear Regression
 	⇥Decision Tree
 	⇥Random Forest
 	⇥Gradient Boosting
 	⇥KNN
##### 5.Model Selection : Tested all the models to check the RMSE & R-squared.
##### 6.Pickle File : Selected model as per best RMSE score & R-squared and created pickle file using pickle library.
##### 7.Webpage &Deployment : Created a web application using streamlit API that takes all the necessary inputs from the user & shows the output. Then deployed project on the Heroku Platform.
